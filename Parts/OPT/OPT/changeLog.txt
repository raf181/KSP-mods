OPT v1.9.0:
	- Separated v1.8.6 into two pack: OPT main(v1.9.0) and OPT legacy(v1.0).
  	  'stali', 'avatar', 'humpback' parts and J-60, J-61, J-81 engines, droptanks are moved to OPT Legacy.
  	  I,J,K fuselage parts are updated and moved to OPT main along with wing parts and 3 engines.
	- Texture update for OPT main, to be more stock alike.
	- Some models are smoothened (at certain angles, some part no longer have different shines to another part)
	- New model for many parts in OPT main.
	- Added JQS
	- Added J Deployment Bay
	- Added J Inline Docking port (small and large)
	- Added J RCS, J RCS drone core
	- Added 3 pre-built crafts
	- Many parts for OPT main moved to their corresponding categories
	- Many parts for OPT main have changed their name to appear more consistent.
	- ILS crew reduced from 5 to 3
	- ISP crew reduced from 5 to 3
	- Part's light now uses the new emission config modules.
	- Increased all liquid fuel tank capacity by 25%
	- Increased J-HT cockpit's fuel capacity by 100%

OPT v1.9.1:
	- Added J Inline Boarding Ramp, J rear boarding ladder, both have a small IVA (in utility section)
	- Added IVA to J-SL, J-HT, J-QS. I wasn't happy with the J crew tank, I will remake it and upload it next patch.
	- ASET prop updated to a version updated by forum user veld (color tag fix)
	- J Aerospike is now under "OPT Propulsion Science Division" manufacturer tab
	- J science lab increased data storage from 500 to 1050
	- Module Lifting Surface's drag values corrected
	- K Spaceplane cockpit's bulkhead profile changed from 'K' to 'k'
	- FSFuelSwitch Mass Discrepancy Error should be fixed
	- In parts config file, part's name have been moved to the top.

OPT v1.9.2
	- Added K 3m Fueltank
	- Added K to Tri 2.5m Engine Mount
	- Added K Space Plane Cockpit's IVA
	- Fixed missing collider for J service bay
	- Fixed unable to EVA from boarding ramp
	- Fixed OPT large, huge pylon and stabilizer a and b's lifting value, they now produce the correct lift (about 3 times more)
	- Added correct drag cube to: J deployment bay, J Cargo Bay, J Service Bay, K Hollow fuselage, K Cargo Bay (this should lower lot's of incorrect drag in some cases)
	- All Cargo bay's lookup radius increased slightly to cover the corners in the cargo bay.
	- Modified K Rear Cargo Ramp's colliders to be less bumpy
	- Fixed "play animation automatically" that caused cargo bays to not shield items inside at launch.
	- Added a dummy animation to K hollow fuselage parts, they now uses module cargo bay and  shields stuff inside properly.
	- Removed J-SL cockpit's 40 mono propellant
	- Fixed K Cockpit's mesh, (above the middle windshield, the mesh was extruding inward)
	- J-SL cockpit now have a pair of built in retrograde RCS thrusters <<----------- should be pretty useful I might consider adding them to other cockpits
	- Stabilizer a and b's max actuation angle lowered from 30 to 20
	- Stock aircraft Balari V SSTO reconfigured slightly (fuel tank positions) , should improve flying when gliding with empty fuel tanks, as well as increased delta V.     
	- J Aerospike's mass increased from 1.21 to 7.26; cost increased from 9k to 11k; ISP at ground reduced from 390 to 380, ISP in space reduced from 420 to 390;
	- OPT's J and K fuselage's lift value rebalanced, j fuselage lift increased by 16%, k fuselage lift increased by 83%.
	- J and K fuselage parts mass increased; J by 10%, K by 20%;

OPT v1.9.9
	• Fixed ModularFuelTank config file, MFT is now properly supported. *MFT will break OPT stock crafts because it automatically replaces all the preconfigured fuel tanks.
	• Added line vesselType = Probe to J drone cores, added line vesselType = Plane to all cockpits
	• Fixed K cockpit's light not working
	• J-92 engine (schramjet) no longer uses fuel from other 'staged' or 'stage disabled' fueltanks. (thanks Flashblade!)
	• Added IVA for J Crew (should hold 10 kerbals but due to some issue it still only hold 8, if anyone find out why, please let me know :))
	• Added IVA for ISL, ISP and Phoenix Cockpit
	• Added support for CCK (allows OPT to have it's own tab in SPH/VAB)
	• Changed Name tag for engines to OPT-E, wing parts to OPT-W for better organization when inside OPT's own category (for CCK)
	• Cockpit's reaction wheel torque re balanced (mostly reduced yaw and pitch).
	• Dark Drive's atmospheric output increased from 30% to 50%
	• OPT wing control surface lift increased by 50% (because many report that they are not effective)
	• Updated ASET props, Firespitter and RPM to latest release
	• Added Kh cargo, hollow fuselage, cargo ramp (6 parts)
	• Added H fuselage parts
	• Removed fuel options from J boarding ramp
	• All tanks using real fuel volume increased by 400%
	• Added nodes to K&KH 6m parts for h fuselage attachment

OPT v2.0.0
	• Added several new RCS parts
	• Added IVA for J science lab and H crew cabin.
	• Fixed JSL, JHT, JQS and KSP IVA windows (was 100% transparent).
	• Changed KH cargo/fuselage's inner node upward by 0.61, so it's centered for 3.75m parts.
	• Further reduced lifting body lift value by up to 10%
	• Cockpit and nose part's lift value reduced by 40%
	• Fixed h fuselage's lift value (reduced)
	• Applied all previous bug fix patches (missing h fuselage fuel and missing tech)
	• Fixed base mass value for MFT (set to -1)
	• Nebula engine(2.5m engine)'s Centre of Mass shifted forward by 1.5 (since the engine's main body isn't modelled)
	• Added TACLS for h crew cabins
	
OPT v2.0.1
	• All OPT RCS now has a specific impulse of 350, and they require QUITE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ELECTRIC CHARGE TO RUN!!! Their technology also moved to Specialized Control (1 tier up).
	• Bug fix: Objects attached to the J deployment node are now shielded properly
	• OPT J Lab now belongs to Advanced Exploration instead of Supersonic flight.
	• OPT H fuselage parts moved to "Advanced Aerodynamics"
	• OPT J fuselage parts moved to "Heavy Aerodynamics" (since it's similar size to the Mk3 rather than Mk2)
	• Mk2 Ram intake moved to hypersonicFlight
	• OPT wing parts technology also moved to "Heavy Aerodynamics"
	• J deployment bay moved to "Heavy Aerodynamics"
	• OPT Kh moved to experimental Aerodynamics. (K fuselage is still Heavy Aerodynamics)
	• H_drone moved to large unmanned
	• OPT mk2 engine's CoM shifted forward by 1m
	• Support for CTT
