- General:
	- Fix a crash-to-desktop due to firing missiles with action groups but without a WM.
	- Add a 'recentlyFiring' property for CameraTools that checks all guns for having fired recently (instead of just the current one) and for having fired a missile recently. Make the camera vessel selection use this too.

	- Missile and countermeasure settings are now accessible in the Gameplay Settings section of the BDA Settings menu.
	- Animate animations in the physics update so that they work with time-scaling.
	- Localisation corrections/updates. Also in German.
	- Lots of optimisations.
	- Add Notes.md for devs with notes on optimisation and the current branches.
	- Add caching for all AudioClips to reduce GC.
	- Optimised access to Krakensbane and FloatingOrigin adjustments.
	- Fix proc structural panel, now properly no longer has lift.
	- HP log scaling now on by default when RUNWAY_PROJECT is enabled.
- UI:
	- Updated German localization by EzBro.
- Competition:
	- Add option to automatically disable the HUD on tournament start.
	- Fixes nukes causing hit craft to be reported as 'Crashed and Burned' in competitions.
- Spawning:
	- Fix spawning breakage due to PRE not being enabled and enable PRE checks and warnings during spawning.
	- Recover KSP's camera after spawning failure.
- Damage:
	- Fix the bug preventing explosive damage applying to buildings.
	- Rework how damage is applied to buildings and how they regenerate.
	- Add a building damage multiplier.
	- Fix reverse raycasts that were using the wrong rays.
	- Fix detonate direction in BDExplosive part, missiles/rockets with ContinuousRod/ShapedCharge warheads should now have properly oriented AoEs.
	- EMP warheads can now be set to be hard/soft EMP in their configs.
- AI / WM:
	- Add a "Debug Extending" button when AI debugging is enabled that prints extending debug info when clicked if the active vessel is extending.
	- Fix GPS missiles not obeying max missile per target setting when the target is traveling at high speeds.
	- Add an Extend Abort Time slider to the AI, where the AI will abort extending if it fails to gain distance for this amount of time. (Note: this isn't a pure timer; while not gaining distance the timer increases, but will otherwise reduce to 0 at half the rate.)
	- Add a 5s cooldown on extending if the Extend Abort Time is triggered (overriden for various extend requests, e.g., dropping bombs/nukes).
	- Dynamically update the extend distance for launching a missile while extending.
	- Limit the DLZ calculation for the extend distance for firing missiles to being maxOffBoresight off-target - avoids extreme extending distances.
	- Expand the WM's Self-Destruct AG to arm and detonate all explosive parts too.
	- Adjust the smoothing for the AoA and G-load limiting from a moving window (with a ~0.6s delay) to double exponential smoothing (with a ~0.1 delay compensated for by a 0.1s ahead prediction).
		- Note: this doesn't fix AoA/G-load limiting, it just improves the response time of its calculations.
- Detectors:
	- Random position noise due to chaff no longer scales with RCS, is instead fixed to a random number between 16 and 256.
- ECM:
	- ECM Jammer and Cloaking devices now can specify resource used when operating (default is EC).
- Weapons:
	- Fixed bug where the target velocity and acceleration was not being reset once a target was no longer tracked which resulted in lead being erroneously compensated for while mouse aiming.
	- Added ability to manually aim guns using GPS coordinates, primarily for artillery. This behavior is not a functionality in Guard Mode, however when a GPS target is manually selected, turrets will now aim to attempt to hit said target.
	- Improved shaped charge warhead behavior, now armor penetration and beyond-armor effect is much more realistic.
		- Warheads now approximately match real-world penetration performance, given the warhead size and caliber are accurate. Dual-purpose and other multi-function warheads will overperform as the equations assume all of the warhead is a shaped charge. Older and larger warheads may also overperform due to modelling being based on modern warheads.
	- Fixed issue with missile and rocket warheads where direction of blasts were not along the directions of their warheads.
	- Added "caliber" field to the BDExplosivePart module, it's an optional field for shaped charge projectiles which influences its effectiveness.
	- apBulletMod now influences shaped charge projectile penetration, modifying this allows for the penetration of shaped charge shells to be tweaked.
	- Added optional "apMod" field to the BDExplosivePart module, it's functions the same way as apBulletMod for bullets and its primary purpose is to allow users to create dual-purpose shaped charge warheads, where part of the tntMass of the warhead isn't going into the shaped charge effect, reducing penetration.
	- Added optional "apMod" field to rocket configuration file. This allows tweaking of rocket penetration, functioning the same way as apBulletMod for bullets, affecting physical armor penetration as well as shaped charge armor penetration if the rocket is equipped with a shaped charge warhead.
	- Armor protection against explosions is now influenced by angling, angling armor now makes it more difficult for the blast to punch through the armor plate.
	- Added global setting that allows for tweaking of armor effectiveness against explosion blast penetration. The higher the setting, the harder to damage parts behind armor plates via blast damage.
	- Tweaked several missiles, bullets and rockets to reflect the new shaped charge mechanics:
		- RBS-15 and RBS-15AL have had their warheads decreased from 300 kg to 200 kg to reflect their real counterparts. Added caliber field, set at 500 mm.
		- AGM-114R Hellfire missile has had its warhead decreased from 12 kg to 8 kg, with a 172 mm caliber to reflect performance estimates of earlier known models of the Hellfire. Warhead may not match -114R performance.
		- AGM-65 Maverick missile is set to have a 305 mm caliber and an apMod field added with performance set to 950 mm of penetration. No good estimates of the warhead penetration were found so an approximate estimate based on a 27 kg charge was used.
		- BGM-71 TOW missile has had its warhead decreased from 10 kg to 3.9 kg and has a 152 mm caliber to be around TOW/ITOW performance.
		- Hydra-70 has had its penetration tweaked with apMod to match estimates of the M151 HEDP warhead penetration performance.
		- AGM-86 now has caliber field, set to 620 mm.
		- Adjusted 120 mm HEAT and AP rounds to have around the same amount of penetration, balanced for gameplay (210 mm / 216 mm). Realistic configs also exist under the names "120mmBulletHEAT" and "120mmBulletSabot", a commented out line in m1Abrams.cfg can be uncommented in order to use these.
	- Offset beam-riding missile laser to the right and up from the targeting camera to mitigate issues of the camera locking on to its own missiles when on CoMLock mode, causing the targeting camera to drive missiles into the ground. Mostly affected Guard Mode behavior.
	- Fixed missile behavior with Detonation Distance set to 0, missiles should no longer phase through armor.
	- Reworks ModuleMissileRearm, now works, integrated with WM, etc.
	- Missiles with a ModuleMissileRearm can now have reloads, be affected by Infinite Ammo.
	- Adds MultiMissileLauncher module.
	- Adds new Infinite Ordinance toggle, for missiles with ModuleMissileRearm/MultiMissileLauncher.
	- Fixes NRE with APS missile interception.
	- Inaccurate or multi-shot APS (CIWS rotary cannon, etc) no longer guaranteed to kill incoming projectiles with first shot.
	- Fixes Max Turret Targets not targeting more than 2 vessels.
	- Fix Gravity gun and other impulse/gravitic laser weapons dealing damage.
	- Fix manual rocket turret aiming.
- Armor:
	- Improved hypervelocity projectile post-penetration effects. Now Whipple shields should work properly, the more spacing between the armor plates the better the performance against hypervelocity rounds.
	- Modified behavior of penetration formula below a projectile L/D ratio of 1 so penetration values are more consistent.
	- Re-added temperature effects to armor protection levels, if the armor reaches its max safe temperature or goes above said temperature, performance is degraded.
	- Added new Armor Aluminium material, based on Aluminium 7039 to provide a larger variety of armor materials to select from.
	- Adds Armor Mass Mult slider to allow tweaking armor weight in-game.
	- Armor Type "none" now disabled armor thickness slider, should fix PAW issue with 1.9.1 installs.
	- Armor Tools now displays total wing srf. area, and wingloading kg/m2.
	- Fix Armor tools mass/cost readout giving incorrect values when using global armor type.
	
v1.5.2.1

	- Adds debugging messages to assist with making custom weapons.
	- Adds MM patch to add liftless Proc Structural Panel if B9 Pwings installed.
	- Reduce frequency (hopefully to none) of null FX object pool entries by catching unloading events too and triggering OnJustAboutToBeDestroyed before recovering vessels.
	- Allow use of the combat seat as the root part.
- UI:
	- Fix exception when resetting colours in Team Icons.
	- Prevent the kill timer from showing in the Loaded Vessel Switcher window for surface vessels.
	- Updated German localization by EzBro.
	- Adds Accuracy readout to the Weapon Debugging telemetry.
	- Setting the Armor Type to 'None' now disables the armor thickness slider; fixes PAW issue in KSP 1.9.1 installs.
- Competition:
	- Fix exception in auto-resuming tournaments when SpawnProbe.craft isn't found.
	- Fix incorrect Kill Steal attribution from 1v1 fights.
	- Abort competition if a team leader still isn't ready to engage (airborne for pilot AI) by the time the start-competition-now timer runs out.
	- Fixes AI/WM not attached to Root Part warning messages on competition start when using combat seats as the root part in RWP.
	- Add option to start competitions despite failures occuring. For tournaments, this only applies after the third attempt fails.
- Spawning:
	- Wait until after vessels are unpacked before reverting the spawn camera - fixes an exception with EVA kerbals and KSPCF.
	- Fix freezing when vessel removal throws an exception.
	- Account for wheels protruding into the ground during instant lowering of vessels.
- GameModes:
	- Space Combat Tools:
		- Better implement SpaceFriction initialization at round start.
		- Fix AI sometimes limiting to idle speed instead of max speed in space.
		- Add limits to prevent G/AoA limiter returning infinity values in space.
	- Battle Damage:
		- Add selfsealing options to Monoprop tanks.
		- Tanks using B9PartSwitcher for fuel switching now get selfsealing options.
- AI:
	- Fix incorrect inputField for off-target dynamic roll damping.
	- Fix RippleIndex Errors from weapons overheating/reloading.
	- Fix AI ignoring max missiles per target setting for GPS missiles
	- Spaceborne pilotAIs will now dodge via RCS translation.
	- Craft with guard mode enabled now automatically receive radar contacts via the datalink from friendlies if they have an onboard radar that can receive radar data (canReceiveRadarData = true in part).
	- Corrections to aiming at orbital speeds and long distances (for deep space combat).
		- Caveats:
			- There is a discontinuity in the way KSP handles floating origin/Krakensbane adjustments at 100km above each world that can adversely affect trans-100km orbit aiming slightly (high bullet speeds mostly negates this).
			- KSP won't load surface vessels when the current vessel is over ~90km (on Kerbin) for some unknown reason despite a sufficient PRE range, so orbital bombardment only works from LKO.
			- The targeting reticle currently isn't being correctly placed when manually aiming at closeby targets (will be fixed later).
- Detectors:
	- Fix IRST preventing Radar GUI close.
	- Fix NRE in targeting camera when the camera parent transform is null.
	- Re-work IR occlusion to look at engine and engine plume heat for non-prop engines, weight parts by mass and proximity to heat source for occlusion, and incorporate occlusion from the engine outside of a 50 deg angle of the engine exhaust.
	- Correct spelling of "receive" (and variants) and adjust BDA parts that use "canRecieveRadarData" to use "canReceiveRadarData" instead ("canRecieveRadarData" is retained for compatibility, but other mods should make this adjustment!).
- ECM
	- Radar missile position distortion due to chaff now relies on the ratio of ECM jammer strength to craft signature with RCS reduction to bias the position distortion from chaff to further behind the craft. Net effect is craft with jammers, and especially low RCS craft with jammers, will have an easier time evading radar missiles.
	- Lockbreak from jammers now affects RCS with RCS reduction instead of base RCS. Craft can now mix RCS reduction parts and jammers to break locks without worrying about them conflicting.
	- Incorporate stand-off jamming effects. Friendly craft with jammers now result in your craft being harder to detect and lock. Strength of this effect is determined by the lockBreakerStrength of the friendly jammers, relative distance of friendly jammers (friendly jammers closer to enemy will have a stronger effect), and if the jammers are close in field of view for the enemy (friendly jammers in same field of view will have a stronger effect). Debug readout is available by enabling the Detectors debug option.
	- AI no longer will turn off jammers automatically if they were manually enabled prior to being turned on by the AI.
- Weapons:
	- Fix FXLookAtConstraint modules on various turrets.
	- Fix incorrect charge sound path for lasers.
	- Make the ABL use proper looping audio and add a cool-down sound.
	- Fix the ABL laser beam continuing to show while overheated when used manually.
	- Fix for NRE when heatseeker is manually selected prior to activating guard mode.
	- Fix Weapon manager PAW engagement options not affecting AI weapon selection in flight.
	- Missiles and nukes will now properly play their explosion sound effects.
	- AI controlled turrets will no longer return to rest position when overheated/reloading.
	- Fix terminal heat guidance for missiles, including not being decoyed by flares.
	- Improve consistency of anti-radiation distance target check.
	- Add paramater gpsUpdates for GPS guided missiles. gpsUpdates >= 0 in the missile config will allow the missile to get position updates of the target from the craft that launched the missile (if it can still see the target) every gpsUpdates seconds.
	- Corrections to tracer placement and alignment at orbital speeds (for deep space combat).
		- Note: Enable "Vessel-Relative Bullet Checks" when at these speeds for correct collision checks between bullets and vessels. Disable it at lower speeds as it can be a CPU hog.
	- Fix delay/penetrating fuze rounds sometimes not detonating.
	- Penetrating rounds now register damage to all parts they hit, not just first.
	- Fix 'Weapon requires EC' message spam if active vessel is not the one with the weapon in question.
	- Weapons using ECPerShot now only drain ElectricCharge if the vessel has sufficient EC to fire the weapon.
	- Use the explosion models and sounds given in MissileLauncher if none are specified in BDAExplosivePart.
	- Adds Active Protection System implementation.
		- Adds new fields: 'isAPS = T/F', 'APSType = [ballistic, missile,omni]'.
		- Adds new Settings.cfg field 'APS_THRESHOLD = n' to set threshold bullet/rocket size for interception.
- Armor:
	- Adjusted post-penetration behavior of high velocity rounds, rounds now erode instead of slowing down at high velocities.
		- Multi-plate armor schemes now behave more realistically and will require more careful material selection and configuration.
		- Whipple shields for hypervelocity rounds are now viable and desirable. This behavior is however still very crude and does not qualitative match realistic behavior.
	- Adjusted stats for S-Glass and Kevlar materials to have realistic RHA equivalency.
		- Re-implemented Tate-Alekseevksy equation for low-ductility materials.
	- Added debug console output for armor penetration behavior. Now when Debug -> Armor is on, console will output armor penetration parameters.

	- Add Air/Ground target preference weighting to Target Priorities.
	- Make the extend toggle apply to air-to-air missiles as well as air-to-air guns.
	- Update the AI GUI help text for the current extending settings.
	- Make the AI GUI vertically resizable.
	- AI will now head to target's last known position if contact lost (out of sight range/angle/radar detection), with accuracy of predicted position decaying over time.

	- Add an altitude steer limiter to the pilot AI.
	- Apply user-defined steer limiters to roll.
	- Force VTOL AI to aim towards targets when trying to fire missiles (if it can't already fire the missile).
	- Add a PID auto-tuning mode:
		- The AI will use gradient descent to optimize the plane's ability to turn to a range of headings and stabilize in those directions.
		- The loss being minimized is ∫f(x,θ)dθ over the range θ ∈ (30°,120°) (using the midpoint Riemann sum), where f(x,θ) is ∫(δp²·(α+t²)/θ² + γ·δr²·(α+t)/100/θ)dt for the current PID values (x) and heading change (θ), where δp is the pointing error, δr is the roll error, α is the fast response relevance and γ is the roll relevance (which is automatically adjusted over time to balance the contribution from the pointing and roll errors).
		- Usage: Once the plane is airborne (and not in combat), enable auto-tuning and set the sliders to the desired values (the defaults are reasonable starting points and can be preset in the SPH; adjusting some of the sliders will restart the auto-tuning), then allow the auto-tuning to run until it stops automatically when the learning rate (LR) decreases to below 1e-3. The PID values will revert to those giving the lowest loss and these will be stored so they can be restored in the SPH.
		- Recommendations:
			1. Set the auto-tuning altitude and speed to those expected to be used in combat.
			2. Use 5-10x time-scaling.
			3. Avoid mountainous terrain.
			4. Tune without dynamic damping first and use the result as the starting point for dynamic damping with all the damping values set to the tuned static damping value and the dynamic damping factors set to 1.
			5. Since the PID values are (currently) being optimized for flying to fixed points, the tuned I value may not be optimal for moving targets in combat and a slightly larger I may be desirable.

	- Increase the HP of the combat seat to the same as a kerbal (500).
	- Add a time scaling option to the GamePlay section of the settings for speeding up/slowing down the game rate while competitions are active.
		- This does not affect the physics time-step, which remains at 0.02, but simply tries to make the in-game clock go faster with respect to a wall clock, so it should not affect the physics (if they're implemented correctly).
		- WARNING: This is likely to mess with any other mod that adjusts the time rate, e.g., TimeControl, if they're active at the same time.
		- WARNING: Consistency of the results (compared to running at normal speed) is not yet verified, but initial results look promising.
- Internal:

	- Add the off-by-one frame fix to ramming and missile guidance.
	- Add logic for planes in Follow mode for the period between taking off and reaching their min altitude.
	- Add unclamped values for the low- and high-speed steer limiters.
- Weapons:
	- Move finalFire checks into a single function that runs in AimAndFire during the FashionablyLate timing phase instead of being spread between Update and FixedUpdate.

- Fix cost of aluminum armor panels.
- Fueltanks will no longer randomly explode when shot.

	- Adjust the ballistic trajectory simulation time-step multiplier based on the distance to the target to give improved debug lines/targeting line visuals.
	- Armor Panels now use Armor Integrity instead of HP.
	- Nukes now support custom FX.
- AI:
	- Also avoid 0 altitude (terrain avoidance) for bodies without solid surfaces or oceans (i.e., Jool).
	- Reworked the integral component of the PID to work as an actual PID again:
		- The integral is no longer reset to 0 when the pitch error changes sign, nor decays with time.
		- The integral is now vector valued to account for coupling between the yaw and pitch axes due to roll and the individual pitch and yaw components are projected out from this integral.
		- The maximum contribution to the steering from the integral component is 1 (similar to the magnitude of the individual components before this change, but larger than the original 0.2 prior to the previous change).
		- The internal yaw damping factor is increased from 0.2 to 0.33 to keep the internal ratios between the axes consistent for each of the P, I and D components (1:0.33:0.1 for pitch:yaw:roll).
	- Use missile velocity vector for evasion instead of missile relative position to prevent turning into missiles when they are at close range. 
	- Use soonest time to closest approach instead of closest distance to select highest threat missile. 
	- Change closest approach point to ignore missile threats to 3 Blast Radius from 1.5 Blast Radius.

	- Remove arc length term from DLZ calculation for ground launched missiles (this was breaking VLS parts).

IMPROVEMENTS
	- Missile evasion:
		- Behavior changes to notch and dive against missiles, pull away before impact for heat seekers only (continuing to notch is more effective against radar missiles). Fix spinning in place behavior that had occurred occasionally.
		- Simplify entry conditions for missile evasion behavior (only occurs within threshold of when your craft is set to dispense chaff/flares regardless of whether it has chaff or flares onboard).
		- Proper throttle settings for chaffing vs flaring.
		- Add check if radar missiles are still boresighted towards craft as a condition to treat missiles as a threat.
	- Shift 'AimAndFireAtEndOfFrame' to occur during the FashionablyLate timing phase of FixedUpdate and rename it 'AimAndFire'. This synchronises firing with the physics instead of waiting until the scene is rendered. It also occurs before Krakensbane adjustments have been made.
	- Simplify target threat to either be 0 (not under attack) or 1 (under attack).
	- Make Kerbal Safety a slider instead of a toggle to allow disabling ejection from cockpits, but still have existing kerbalEVAs deploy parachutes.

		- Adds some new rocketdef config options
			- gravitic = foo //rocket will temporarily modify weight of parts hit by rocket and its explosion
			- impulse = foo //rocket applies non-damaging impulse to parts hit by rocket/explosion

			- Prioritize weapons that are within their firing angle.
			- Adjust weapon prioritisation of being within firing angle for firing angle scaling with target size and distance.
		- Added VIPs, which allow you to set up behavior such as guarding your VIP, or attacking enemy VIPs and ignoring craft defending them.
			- Add new "Is VIP" toggle to the weapons manager. Allows you to set a craft as a "VIP" which opens up new target priority options.
			- Added new target priority options "Protect My VIPs" and "Attack Enemy VIPs". Setting positive values on these sliders will result in the craft targeting enemies that are targeting VIPs on its own team, or attacking enemy VIPs, respectively.
		- Don't try to engage torpedoes with guns/missiles/lasers.
		- Use other weapons for ground targets if missiles fired is greater than or equal to max missiles on target setting.
		- Don't use arc length calculation for torpedo DLZ since they can turn much more quickly in water than airborne missiles.
	- Advanced Targeting option in BDA Settings:
		- Enables turrets to target multiple simultaneous targets
		- Enables selecting CoM or non-CoM targeting options
	- General:
		- Updated tournament parsing script that puts subfields in their own columns in the CSV file.
		- Move GetRadius to VesselExtension.cs.
		- Localisation changes for steer limiter.
		- Update Typhoon engine (caesar_hone_60.cfg)

v1.4.1
FIXES
	- Fix missile hit attribution from missiles without BDExplosivePart modules.
	- Don't include negative thrust percentage drives (Danny2462 drives) in max acceleration calculation as they don't contribute to the thrust.
	- Fix BDRotaryRail stack overflow and give warning if the conditions that gave rise to it occur again.
	- Put chute into right state before deploying it with WM AG.
	- Don't assign gender to spawned kerbals, let KSP do it.
	- Fix CheckSafeToFireGuns for debris preventing firing due to being too close to the target.
	- Reduced (but not eliminated) exceptions due to comet vessels.
	- Change the minimum damage amount of 0.01 to 0 as this was the cause of the fire damage over time applying despite the game being paused or slowed with time control.
	- Fix NREs in explosions from ClusterBomb.cs
	- Add KSP version dependent checks for part.IsKerbalEVA and crew.ResetInventory.
	- Updates Rocket targeting, fixes aimer alignment
	- Updates laser Infos with proper resource usage
IMPROVEMENTS
	UI and quality-of-life tweaks:
	- Add fault tolerance for missing bullet defs in GetInfo.
	- Add similar handing of missing or broken rocket info as for bullet info.
	- Move ConfigNode functions to their own translation unit.
	- Add 'Clear Debris Now' and 'Clear Bystanders Now' buttons to the Vessel Spawner window (in Spawn Options).
	- Option for using the old format of the Vessel Switcher window ('t'). Option for reassigning teams on spawn or retaining the original team name defined in the SPH. Right clicking 'T' in the Vessel Switcher window resets vessels to their original teams. Spawning from 'Folders' assigns the folder as the team name if team reassignment is enabled.
	- Remember position of RWR, Radar and TargetingCamera windows.
	- Add optional extra parameter to CreateExplosion to specify the weapon name (to be used for in-game messages for missile strikes).

	- Configure how seats are filled in the Vessel Spawner Window: minimal, all control points, also cabins. Crewed weapons always get filled with 1 crew.
	- Option to reset maxHitPoints on vessels loaded into flight mode (e.g., during spawning). Uses the MM patched value if available.
	- More consistent addition of _1, _2, etc., to vessel names which should make teams of the same vessel have valid results summaries in many cases without having to rename each craft (which is still a better solution!), not just the files.
	- Add RESULT line to competition log to indicate overall result of the competition (needed for teams).
	- Updated format of log files for teams. Updated tournament parsing script.
	- Add break-down of deaths (clean Bullets, clean Missiles, clean Rams, Assists, Suicides) and kills (Bullets, Missiles, Rams), and normalised death order and death time to the results summary.
	- Set KSP version of SpawnProbe to 1.9.0 to avoid issues with spawning on older installations.
	Kerbal Safety:
	- Move kerbal safety code from autonomous combat seat check in BDACompetition.cs to KerbalSafety.cs with its own toggle.
	- Free-falling kerbals deploy parachutes.
	- Kerbals in falling command seats leave the seat.
	- Vessels (and kerbals therein) are recovered during spawning instead of getting destroyed.
	- Surviving kerbals are recovered and immediately available for flying in the next competition instead of being MIA.
	- Ejection from cockpits is still a WIP.
	Battle Damage:
	- Battle damage is now configurable with multiple sub-categories, with the following toggles. Per-hit proc chance is also adjustable.
	- Fuel Tanks
		- FuelTanks will now leak when hit
		- Tanks may be configured to be self-sealing, trading some fuel capacity for leak resistance
		- Tank leak rate and leak duration can be adjusted
	- Ammo Boxes
		- Ammo boxes will potentially explode if hit
		- Ammo Boxes can be set to explode when destroyed
		- Adds ModuleCASE to ammo parts. Caselevel can be set from 0-2, higher levels reduce ammo explosion damage, at the cost of increased mass and cost.
	- Engines
		- Engine thrust reduced when hit, will start leaking fuel/catch fire/shut down when badly damaged
		- Intakes performance reduced when hit
		- Engine Gimbals can fail when hit
	- Wings
		- Wing damage per hit reduced
		- Wing lift loss capped at 50% total lift
		- Wing damage per hit is now configurable
		- Ailerons can fail when hit
	- Subsystems
		- Subsystem components
		- SAS/Radar/etc can be disabled when hit
	- Command
		- Control damage when hit
		- Pilots can be killed from cockpit damage
	- Fires - if a tank is leaking fuel, chance for leak to ignite
		- Fire damage over time
		- Fires in cockpits or other crewed or crew adjacent parts will be automatically extinguished.
		- Adds ModuleSelfSealingTank, can be toggled to prevent tanks leaks until tank receives substantial damage. it also adds the ability to configure fueltanks and engines to carry firebottles to extinguish fires
	RCS:
	- Improved RCS calculation accuracy and speed, your craft's RCS may be slightly different from 1.4.0.7
	- Recalculate RCS occasionally when parts are lost (to account for damage or missiles firing)
	- Fix engine afterburner textures affecting RCS calculation (was an issue for Tiger and Cheetah engines from AirplanePlus)
	Missiles:
	- New variables that affect heat seeking missile performance: lockedSeekerFOVBias, and lockedSeekerVelocityBias. See Sidewinder config file for more details.
	- Fixed allAspect and maxOffBoresight to work as intended. Vertical launch systems (VLS) and high off-boresight missiles should work as intended. See AIM-120 config file for details.
	- Add ability for Air-to-Ground missiles to lead targets based on their velocity.
	- Fixed Dynamic Launch Zone calculation, should result in more close-range missile fires and high off-boresight missiles only firing when they are likely to hit their target.
	- Better explanation of what missile parameters do added to Sidewinder and AIM-120 config files (new heat seeker value description in Sidewinder config file).
	- Updated torpedo tuning from Kurgan.
	Target Priority:
	- Target acceleration target priority now returns TWR/10 instead of instantaneous acceleration/10. Is set to -1 when target craft loses engines.
	- Less teammates engaging target priority now returns -1 when all teammates are engaging the same target instead of 0 (allows for better ganging up on the same target).
	Parts:
	- New armor panels, rescaled armor panel part mass, cost, HP to scale properly based on size.
	- Remove AIM-4 missiles, are moved to the Flying Circus mod for now, planned to be re-released in a future BDA expansion mod.
	- Added new Typhoon engine to fill the gap between Juno and Panther.
	Effects:
	- New FireFX effect

v1.4.0.7

v1.4.0.5
FIXES
	- Fix craft being able to fire radar missiles at a target they could not lock when another target they could lock was nearby. This usually happened when the target launched missiles, since missiles have a 999 m^2 RCS by default.

v1.4.0.4
FIXES
	- Bugfixes for rocket turrets.
	- Bugfix for Oerlikon bulletType.
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Tweaks to fire angle:

	- Improvements to RCS/stealth/ECM:
		- Craft with a lower modified radar signature (from ECM Modules that reduce signature) no longer have increased lock range. The range at which craft are locked will be accurate based on the RCS Window in the SPH/VAB if no jammers are used.
		- Re-worked RCS system. Calculate 95 azimuth/elevation pairs across 0-180 deg Az, 23 to -23 deg El, take the 3rd quartile of the distribution to use as the total RCS.
		- Scale RCS up by 4 to better match reality and provide better balancing against stock radars.
		- Display worst three Az/El pairs in the BDA editor window so that users can improve their design.
		- Fix to turn on all ECM jammers when an incoming radar-missile is detected.
	- Improvements to missiles:
		- Allow firing multiple missiles at the same radar target without losing radar lock. Firing missiles at multiple locked targets needs considerable work to be feasible.
		- Fix known issues with terminal guidance.
		- Add option for configuring FireFOV of a turret (fires when pointing within this angle of target). Reduce step size of fire interval to 0.5s.
	- Improvements to pilot AI:
		- Allow users to set "Firing Angle," the angle the weapons are within of being on target before firing. Default is 1 deg. Setting is on Weapons Manager. Setting only affects weapons with a yaw and pitch range of less than 5 degrees for both axes.
		- Make wing commander 'spread' and 'lag' values persistent.
		- Allow pilots in the "Attack" command to evade if they are being fired at by another craft
		- Sliders for controlling threshold and period of collision avoidance between vessels.
		- Allow craft to evade if they are under attack while being commanded to "Attack."
	- UI improvements:
		- Improved behaviour for entering spawn coordinates and altitude.
		- Add a slider in tournament settings to control delay between heats.
	- Other improvements:
		- Further balancing of the 30mm tnt mass to 0.077 (from 0.081).
		- B9 Proc Wings HP patch

v1.3.8.2
IMPROVEMENTS

	- Remove surface attachment option from combat seat.
	- Add option to automatically kill off WMs after 5s when they become uncontrolled.
	- Kerbals in falling combat seats eject to safety.
	- Deploy halo chute for falling kerbals. Add AG to WM to deploy chutes on external kerbals.

v1.3.8.1
FIXES
	- Report death time to web orchestration in seconds instead of minutes
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Autonomous combat seats: when disabled (default) during competitions, combat/command seats disable the AI when the kerbal leaves the seat and vessels that are comprised of only a single combat/command seat explode.
	- Reduce max fireBurstLength to 10 and stepIncrement to 0.05 to allow more control of gun burst length.
	- Updated HP patch from CeruleanEyes

v1.3.8
FIXES
	Main fixes:

		- Explosions are no longer limited to 5 at a time.
		- Fixed decals not being returned to the object pool so that they work efficiently now.
	Other fixes:
		- Use the correct spawn distance value in the remote orchestration.
		- Unity's fake nulls strike again: properly reset explosion object pools on scene changes.
		- KSP is labelling some missiles as debris. Detect these and don't remove them.
		- Bugfixes, memory leak fixes and optimisations.
		- Don't use Parallel.ForEach to update ramming information as Unity doesn't like get_transform being called from threads.
		- Assign font attributes in Awake instead of Constructor.
		- Fix potential NRE in ApplyDamage in PooledBullet.cs
		- Fix a potential NRE in continuous spawning where a spawned vessel gets destroyed before it's activated.
		- Fix special case of vessels with combat seats getting renamed.
		- Reset spawn position and rotation after spawning as sometimes KSP packs and unpacks craft and resets things!
		- Wait an extra update during spawning to allow reference transforms to be assigned.
		- Use altitudes from FlightGlobals when raycasting fails during spawning.
IMPROVEMENTS
	Main improvements:
		- Rebalance of explosion damage from bullets to approximate the previous DPS of the browning, vulcan and gau-8.
		- AI/WM now cost 0.
	Other improvements:
		- Remove the '5' from the options for heat size in the automatic vessels per heat optimisation to ensure a minimum heat size of 5.
		- Add configurable keybindings for tournament setup and running. Improve layout of 'Edit Inputs' window.
		- Added an 'auto-enable vessel-switching' option to general settings. Added 'auto' mode for tournament generation that chooses an appropriate number of vessels per heat and distributes the deficit over multiple heats.
		- Set up paintball decal pools when the paintball toggle is toggled.
		- Extra damage sliders in-game
		- Small optimisation to avoid reallocating Ray instance in PooledBullet.cs
		- Add the explModelPath to the browninganm2.cfg
		- Use a split slider for tournament rounds setting to allow up to 100 rounds.
		- Reuse deathOrder variable instead of fetching it from BDACompetitionMode.Instance again.
		- Use minSpeed instead of idleSpeed in steer limiter. Scale possibleAccel by 1/15 as before (but without G) for now until we find a better solution.
		- Additional regular check for vessels renamed as planes due to the combat seat.
		- Automatically end a continuous spawning competition when there's nothing left to spawn and <2 active craft.
		- Add a max altitude GM killer.
		- Updated Python scripts for parsing competition results logs.
		- Also trigger competition end when there's only 1 team left.
		- Include engine acceleration but not gravity in GetSteerLimiterForSpeedAndPower as it makes gliders and RegainEnergy work better.
		- Use afterburners when regaining energy.
		- Trigger the target scan after all the teams have been assigned.
		- Enable target priority by default.
		- Stop extending when changing targets.
		- Include death time and normalised death order in web orchestration reporting with surviving player death order/time set to max

	- Re-enable detonation of armed explosive parts when they are destroyed.
	- Use partHit position instead of vessel.CoM in proximity calculations. Estimate distance on next fixed update and detonate if expected to collide next fixed update.
	- Use time to closest point of approach for AAM guidance.
	- Use new Saturn texture created by Stardust

v1.3.6.3
FIXES
	- Don't autodestruct missiles if the explosive parts are using the override.
	- Show message about why the vessel spawning timed out.
	- Prevent windows from being competely off-screen (the drag region may still be off-screen though). Toggling "Strict Window Boundaries" will bring all the windows onto the screen if you can't find them.
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Absolute Distance vs Distance Factor toggle and expanded Spawn Distance slider for ranges up to 20km. (Note: for distances over 10km, it struggles due to the PRE and terrain. Using an airborne spawn first can help fix this.)
	- Add 'Detonate At Minimum Distance' to MMG. (Note: MMG doesn't have an 'ignore friendlies' yet.)
	- Add 'Detonate At Minimum Distance' for explosive parts too.
		- Note: the effect of 'Detonate At Minimum Distance' is to delay the detonation/triggering once it's within the detonation radius until the distance is minimised.

v1.3.6.2
FIXES
	- Increase the ground finding raycast distance for spawning at ground level for large radii. - Give the craft an extra 5s to land and set the spawnFailureReason if it times out.

v1.0.0

* NEW FEATURES:

  * Radar & Stealth, re-design of how the radar system works:
	- New radar reflection shader (credit: original great idea by JR!), calculating cross section in m^2:
	   + allows building for stealth using angled surfaces (“scatter those pesky radar waves away!”)
	   + calculation is normalized so that a 1x1 structural plate directly frontally facing the radar yields a return of exactly 1 m^2
	- Redesign of the radar system, radars all have different ranges & detection performance:
	   + radar part configs changed, new fields (floatcurves) to define detection and lock/track performance, new field to specify ground clutter effectiveness
	- New in-editor analysis window to help evaluate a craft’s cross section and performance against selectable radars
	- New options for configuration of radar guided missiles in the part config:
	   + can now explicitly specify active seeker performance (via a FloatCurve, similar to radars)
	   + can now explicitly specify the static radar cross section of a missile for detection purpose
	- Adjustment of the Chaff countermeasure system: more gradual effect of decoying missiles away (instead of previous “all-or-nothing”)
	- Adjustment of IR missiles and flare countermeasures: simulating now more of a “imaging infrared” seeker than an old dumb seeker – to be successfully decoyed, flares have to more closely match the thermal spectrum of the part the seeker has locked on to

  * Massive improvements to ballistic missile guidance and modular missiles, ability to simulate ICBM flight paths:
	- Ballistic guidance has been enhanced to allow firing missiles accurately even at distances greater than 500 km
	- A new field called BallisticOverShootFactor has been added to missiles, the greater the value the further the missile will go before the terminal maneuver begins
	- By default all missiles now can steer in vacuum. New field called "vacuumSteerable" can be set to false to disable this behaviour    
	- Auto SAS activation when the missile is fired. Before it was only activated if the parent vessel had it switched on.
	- Improved the Cruise and Ballistic Guidance. Ballistic Guidance will switch to AGM guidance as soon as it reached the 50% of the distance
	- Guard mode in space will consider orbiting vessels as "flying" (air targets), hence engagement of space targets is possible now
 
  * New dedicated sonar ping and torpedo ping sounds, courtesy of PapaJoe!

* FIXES / ENHANCEMENTS:

  * Localization updates, including chinese localization (thanks @ACEA)
  * Fixed indestructible Kerbals - weapons/explosions have effect on Kerbals again! (thanks @Designer225)
  * Fixed AIPilot problem with drag estimations (thanks @RichardDastardly)
  * Fix missile infinite fuel
  * Fix rwr window invisible in fresh installs
  * Display ranges of RWR and radar display now linked, selectable display range of radar display up to configured PRE physics max range!
  * Window position saving also for vesselswitcher
  * Prevent active radar missiles locking onto anything they see, now obey engagement settings
  * Sonar pings and torpedos only show on RWR if vessel is splashed/submerged
  * Fix guard mode "cheating" - now must have detected an enemy with radar/sonar or with visual range before it can attack it
  * If a cruise missile has terminal guidance, it can be switched off (before launch) in the part action window. The missile will then be purely gps guided without engaging its terminal targeting mode
  * If debug labels are enabled, upon entering the editor all bda parts & their properties (if relevant for balancing) are dumped into .csv files for convenient analysis in excel
  * Complete review of all event handlers, should reduce some actual or potential nullrefs upon explosive vessel disassembly
  * General performance improvements due to code refactoring

* New Parts

	* Courtesy of SpannerMonkey 
		- BDA MK1 Sonar Pod
		- Sting Ray  BDA LightWeight Torpedo
		
* Notes on Naval Combat Features

	* Current implementation of "Sonar" reuses the current Radar code. Future state will have dedicated windows and naming convention
	* Activating a "Sonar" pod still says "Activate Radar"
	* A Sonar is defined by setting the rwrThreatType = 6
		- Sonar rules
			- Will only detect vessels that are underwater (> 20meters)
			- Sonar will not function if vessel is in flight
			- Sonar does not detect "Landed" vessels, only splashed
			- Normal Radar does not detect underwater vessels, still detects "Splashed" i.e. Boats
	* Engagment type "SLW" only targets underwater (submarines) and Splashed (Boats)
