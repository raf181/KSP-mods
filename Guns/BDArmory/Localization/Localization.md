--BDA-RWP Localization--

If you want to help translate BDA, it would be a great help.

--How to translate--

Localization files are easy to make. Create a copy of the BDarmory/Localization/en_us.cfg and BDArmory/Localization/UI/en-us.cfg files and rename it according to the language being translated:
* "es-es.cfg" for Spanish
* "es-mx.cfg" for Mexican Spanish
* "pt.cfg" for Portugese
* "fr.cfg" for French
* "de-de.cfg" for German
* "it.cfg" for Italian
* "ja.cfg" for Japanese
* "ru.cfg" for Russian
* "zh-cn.cfg" for Simplified Chinese

Note: filename is not too important, the important part is the language identifier inside the `Localization` block, e.g.,
```
Localization
{
    de-de
    {
```
